# Landing Page Project

## Functionality
There are three main functionalities in this project: 
* The first is building a navigation bar dynamically, based on each section showed in the page. 
* The second is listening for clicks on the navigation bar and scroll to the corresponding section. 
* Finally, when scrolling is happening, an active class is set to the section in the viewport, as well as the corresponding link in the navigation bar.
